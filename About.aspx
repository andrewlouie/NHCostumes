<p>Children grow so quickly; each Halloween new costumes are purchased to be worn less than a handful of times.  Many costumes are discarded ending up in landfills or packed away in grandma's attic. Wouldn't it make more sense to rent costumes for a lower cost and not have to wonder what to do with them after Halloween festivities end?  This is what initiated Helen Smith and Natasha Yates to start NH Costumes. They wanted to offer rentals of quality costumes for a portion of the cost of buying a new costume.

NH Costumes also offers anyone with extra costumes around the house the opportunity to consign their costumes. This is a great way to make some extra cash while allowing you to still have access to the costumes in the future.

We encourage you to look around the website to see all we have to offer.  Make sure you check back frequently as consignors are bringing in new costumes daily!
